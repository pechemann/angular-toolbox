    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction to Angular Toolbox concepts</h3>
    <p>
        Angular Toolbox (ATX) is a framework that provides developers both, development and production tools,
        to facilitate the creation of Angular apps.
    </p>
    <p>
        It meets recurring needs not covered by other frameworks and identified during the development
        of websites or desktop applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        The framework was designed not to interfere with other libraries.
        It strongly separates concerns, to reduce application size and maintain good performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Development tools, such as the ATX HTTP Mocking Framework, were created to focus on parallel backend and frontend development.
        The goal is to increase productivity while reducing the risk of bugs, by relying on interface design in distributed environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the general ideas is to encourage good development practices based on OOP concepts.
    </p>

<section class="col-xl-9 mb-4">
    <h3 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple!</h3>
    <p>
        A major challenge when creating APIs is defining the right granularity.
        Framework designers tend to address all possible needs from a single entry point.
        The problem with this approach is that the couplings between components are often poorly defined,
        which unnecessarily increases the size of the bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typescript interfaces are a good way to partially solve this problem.
        To go further, the ATX framework follows the OOP principle "do one thing and do it well".
        There are several purposes behind the way we implement this concept.
        They are based on the observations below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            most of the features of a framework are not used within a project (it varies from project to project)
        </li>
        <li>
            complex APIs have longer learning curve
        </li>
        <li>
            the higher the display layer, the less flexible the component
        </li>
        <li>
            the less modular the API, the less test coverage
        </li>
        <li>
            no matter how complex an API is, it will not cover all needs
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, we consider that it is not useful to push this logic to its paroxysm.
        What we are trying to do is make the developer's job as easy as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="no-dependency">No Dependency</h3>
    <p>
        The only dependency of the ATX framework is Angular! You will not find any third party libraries.
        <br>
        This is a core principle of Angular Toolbox. Here too, this is a choice made based on observations.
    </p>
    <h4 id="security-issues">1. Security Issues</h4>
    <p>
        More and more utility libraries are affected by security issues.
        This can critically affect your framework, especially when the 3<sup>rd</sup> party library is no longer maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you develop your own framework, it is your responsibility to ensure maximum quality;
        otherwise your project may be taken over by a competitor.
    </p>
    <h4 id="dependency-updates">2. Dependency Updates</h4>
    <p>
        Every Angular developer has had to deal with the problem of dependency updates.
        The nightmare begins when you change the Angular version and 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries are not compatible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Frameworks work the same way!
        <br>
        Since Angular Toolbox has no dependency to 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries, it easier to provide patches and updates.
    </p>
    <h4 id="test-coverage">3. Test Coverage</h4>
    <p>
        The problem with the amount of libraries available on the web is that nothing can guarantee the
        quality of the code and the effectiveness of the associated test suites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Testability is an important aspect of the ATX framework.
        We cannot claim that the framework is bug-free, nor that test coverage is complete.
        However, we do not release new functionalities without trying to provide strong test suites.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fact that Angular Toolbox has no dependencies goes a long way in achieving this goal.
    </p>
    <h4 id="bundles-size">4. Bundles Size</h4>
    <p>
        As we mentioned before, some libraries may embed unnecessary features and increase the size of the bundles.
        By maintaining full control of the code, the ATX framework avoids this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, we are careful not to include unnecessary code in core functionality.
